# WildfireSonification
An exploration of various ways to sonify ODF (Oregon Department of Forestry) data on Wildfires, 2000-2022. 

This project primarily uses Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Kyma. 

See 'WildfireSonification.ipynb' for my work utilizing Numpy and Pandas to perform data cleaning, as well as to visualize various features using Matplotlib. 

'WildfireSonification.pdf' is a description of my workflow and project outcomes. 

Each folder contains various sound files, respective to which data parameters were mapped to specific sonic outcomes (certain features were mapped to pitch, amplitude, spatial location, etc in various iterations).
